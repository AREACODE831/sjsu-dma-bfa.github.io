            Lorem Ipsum is simply dummy text of the printing and typesetting
            industry. Lorem Ipsum has been the industry's standard dummy text
            ever since the 1500s, when an unknown printer took a galley of type
            and scrambled it to make a type specimen book. It has survived not
            only five centuries, but also the leap into electronic typesetting,
            remaining essentially unchanged. It was popularised in the 1960s
            with the release of Letraset sheets containing Lorem Ipsum passages,
            and more recently with desktop publishing software like Aldus
            PageMaker including versions of Lorem Ipsum.

          <h2>About</h2>
          <p>
            CADRE Media Lab is pleased to announce Digital Autonomy, an exhibition of
            digital photography, video, painting, sculpture, and unclassifiable media
            hosted on New Art City that explores the multitude of interdependent signals
            crisscrossing the spatio-temporal void. While never physically co-present,
            Seniors in their culminating semester of their BFA degree in Digital Media Art
            came together in digital space and found synaptic resonance; a cognitive
            sympathy fostered by digital signals.
          </p>
          <p>
            The name itself, Digital Autonomy, is a linguistic performance of cognitive
            dissidence. All digital objects are destined for translation, an act that requires
            a source, processor, and intended receiver. It begs the question; can any
            digital-thing, be autonomous?
          </p>
          <p>
            Digital Autonomy asks the viewer to engage in fantasy, consider the
            physicality of the bodies they inhabit, cast spells over networks, and pokes
            holes in the cultures of post-colonial frameworks. As we begin to slowly
            emerge from our socially distant adaptations, the work imagines new
            possibilities for the kind of world we are passing into. The artists in Digital
            Autonomy suggest new forms of relationships between signals, objects, and
            environments; redefining body & space on their own terms.
