        <div class="statementTitle">Artist Statement</div>
        <div class="statement">"As Sensorial Beasts are..." is a series of 3D models and digital artworks covering Autism Spectrum Disorder's subtopic on social interactions and perception in a virtual setting. With the increasing usage of online and virtual connections, people are bound to link to narratives and information. However, people diagnosed within the Autism Spectrum Disorder tell a different story, involved to change themselves into a representation or an avatar. Through their personas, they can express themselves as beings beyond their humanity while introducing parts of their personality and identity to their peers. This exhibition expands and explores this topic by guiding audiences into a unique virtual wilderness: the forest and the cavern. Outside, there will be colorful beasts with various personalities, drawing viewers to observe and appreciate their social natures. The subterranean passage covers the mixed ambiance of the internal mental workings of how these beasts interpret the dangerous realities of their worlds. The exhibition works as an anthology, allowing audiences to focus on a specific artwork as its own narrative realm.</div>

                      <div class="bioTitle">Project Description</div>
                      <div class="bio"> A combination of 3D virtual models and digital art are used to create my exhibition, <i>As Sensorial Beasts Are...</i>. I want to convey the mixed emotions of how people with Autism go through and transform. Thus, each artwork has their own story while subtly addressing the positive and negative implications in the character's life.  The forest contains two model-focused artworks featuring a bunny and a wolf, themed to embrace Autism behavior and mindset through self and passion. The first model, Love Note, Introducing… what he is, centralizes the innocence of life, expressing himself despite hints of Autism-related symptoms. I include visual and textual imagery on the flying papers to give hints to who Tom, the bunny, is on a personal level. Along with the art description, I want viewers to get close and explore his space, knowing his background, weakness, and reaction to his environment. The other model, Guardian, It Hears, celebrates the passion of oneself through limitations and personal interests. According to research, people with Autism can have extreme concentration on subjects they favor showing little to no genuine care for other topics. For the wolf, he disregards sight but takes advantage with his auditory skills to serve as support for beasts in the forest. The cave conveys a serious and mysterious tone for my digital artworks. Show, Don’t Tell is an abstraction and a reflection of the viewer’s perception and impression towards whomever they face. Normally, people with Autism will awkwardly speak or attempt to verbally communicate. However, most, especially introverted autistic people, are late with their verbal development and may come out as silent or shy. I want audiences to look and ponder their initial reactions about their implications toward the beasts. Lastly, It, Innocence, Potential, Standard, Withhold, Broken takes a dark turn of Autism mentality going unchecked and pairing with other degrading mental issues. Childhood development is the most critical part of human growth. With autistic people, it is important to balance growth and polishing communication and social skills. Unfortunately, education, peer, and self-judgement can degrade a person and people with Autism have a higher rate of mental degradation if it goes unchecked.  </div>
