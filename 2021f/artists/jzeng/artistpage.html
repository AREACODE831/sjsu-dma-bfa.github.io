    <!-- Artist Bio:
  Jiajie Zeng was born and raised in Guangzhou, China. He considers digital media art as an art performance that not only closely connects to the digital era but also is the combination of art and the newest technology, which can provide the freshest experience to the audience and break the stereotype of the art performance. He mainly concentrates on game design, 3D modeling, and interactive design. He believes that a 3D environment could provide a similar or more experience than reality to different senses through emulating reality or creating something that doesn’t exist in reality, which can stimulate people’s imagination and eyes.


  Artist Statement:
  My work is created using 3D modeling to express what he has been experiencing during covid-19. And I know My work is created using 3D modeling to express what I have been experiencing during covid-19. And this topic will closely connect to most of the audience, which is a good way to resonate with them. During covid-19, I feel the loneliness that I have never ever had in these two years: I just make some close friends after transferring to SJSU on 19 Fall, and we cannot hang out and have some conversation in reality; I cannot imagine I have had many festivals by myself for that long period. When festival like Christmas and Lunar New Year is coming, loneliness becomes a huge monster that I cannot beat. I create the frame of the home by using Mozilla Hub because it provides many construction materials and common tools that easily get the effect that I wanted. For the furniture, I decide to make them into the low-poly looking with the 3D modeling tool called Blender to meet the requirement of file size. In the part of the texture that I used on the furniture and wallpaper, I go find some pictures like JPG and PNG files from Google and resize them by using Photoshop. I use the festive atmosphere and empty home to create a contrast: I prepare everything is needed for Chinese New Year but nobody is coming. And also, I create a puzzle that is narrow and winding to express there are some things in my heart during the pandemic but I have no chance to voice out, such as the racial hatred and violent events that happened to Asian people and other races. Encountering it, I feel really helpless and innocent because people should be happy and gather with who they are close to. Nobody should be suffered from this loneliness. This is what I want to convey to the audience. -->
