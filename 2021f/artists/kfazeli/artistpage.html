  <!-- Artist Bio:
  Kayvon Fazeli is an interdisciplinary artist whose work plumbs the depths of the duality between beauty and horror. His work across numerous mediums and softwares displays his firm beliefs that even the most seemingly damaged need loving attention. He explores this theme through a multitude of mediums, from photography and video, to animation and 3d modeling, each creating compelling experiences which allow the viewer to see themselves in both the horrific elements as well as the beautiful.

  Artist Statement:
  My journey as an artist began when my peers put down their pencils and stopped drawing and I did not. This moment revealed to me my greatest passion: Creation. I was fascinated by the profoundness of being able to create the many images that were constantly zooming around in my mind. I knew, as I gained experience with the arts, that I would never stop creating art and I sought out further methods and mediums through which to convey my messages, thoughts, and beliefs.

  My drive to create new works and explore new mediums lead me to pursue a degree in Digital Media Arts while simultaneously working as a graphic designer. I pushed myself to my creative limits by fulfilling the rigid responsibilities of the brand-focused advertising world, while also expanding my capabilities through education. This dichotomy of hard-edged high-design and free flowing expansive creativity in school led me to one of  my favorite themes within my work: Duality. You may look up the definition of duality as you wish, but the meaning my work focuses on is the quality of a thing being both itself and its opposite.

  As such, my work focuses on objects and images which convey this idea. For example:  a robot with the human quality of shyness, a rendered bedroom designed to be comfortable while consisting of furniture made of viscera, and projection mapping onto a skeleton the internal and external worlds of the mind, and many many more. Each of these works explores duality, and challenges the viewer to look into their own life to discover the parallels. My work is intended to disturb, and my subject matters are employed to this purpose. By using imagery of human body parts, blood, bone and organs, especially depicted with the same love and care that one would expect a flower or landscape to be depicted, I set the viewer on edge and it is this edge which allows me to sink my point into the viewer. -->
