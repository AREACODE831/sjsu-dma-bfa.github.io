  <!-- Artist Bio:
  My name is Brian Ressler, and I am a Digital Media Artist that comes from the city of San Diego.  My journey, has been turbulent, initially taking exclusive interest in computer science and engineering. But as we all know life is a curious thing, and eventually I felt unsatisfied with this trajectory. I wanted to do something creative, and more meaningful than just the mundaneness of technology for utilitarian purposes.  Over the years, I have aspired to create meaningful projects rooted in my knowledge of programming and other complex processes. I have also taken an interest in web design and acquired a large amount of knowledge of the creative industry on top of what I know about the art world.  Having worked in the web design industry, I do not wish to loose site of what I can do outside of that.  I like to believe that one can inform the other, and that I can use what I learn and gain to create newer, bigger, and more interesting projects.

  Artist Statement:
  I am a Digital Media Artist and web designer specializing in the medium of web, creating conceptual projects that use cutting edge technology in ways that are not intended to focus on said technology for utilitarian purposes.  Rather, the purpose of my work is to convey a message about something profound that these technologies can help us to see. Specifically, my work often includes the theme of presence and how presence can be generated in a meaningful way without what we would consider to be true presence.  This is especially relevant today, where we are consistently relying on technologies to do something as simple as talking to each other and expressing ideas.  My aim is not to have a pessimists view on the matter, but rather I want to embrace this idea of digital presence by offering new ways of doing so that aren’t so mundane and frustrating in the sense that these technologies can often limit how we can how we can express ourselves.

  My process is very iterative in nature.  I first try find out what I can get working technologically, to prove conceptually, and based on what I discover, I then start to build the whole of the project.  In the case of Empathy, the electronics, and the software, they inform the physical component of it, by staying true to things like physical dimensions, but at the same time, still trying to retain conceptual relevance in my designs.  My projects likewise often consist of microcontrollers, web-based code, plastic filaments, spray paint, etc. An example of a project that is similar in nature to the context of the project being shown today is Confessions (2017). That project denotes my initial interest in creating projects that use a combination of electronics and web, a curiosity for bringing the non-real to our world and enabling others to share in that experience.

  With regards to my inspirations, there are several incredible digital projects that I have looked to.  Recently, I discovered the work of Victor Diaz and Sergio Galan who exhibited a project called City Firefly’s which was exhibited in Madrid where “players” were encouraged to get on their phones and interact with this invented “threat” as they call them, to achieve some sort of collective purpose. While I can cite more examples, the message I am trying to convey is that I take inspiration from artists doing similar things but in incredibly unique ways, and scale.  My aim is to create projects that can also create a broader impact, and a sense of monumentality in a way that is unique to me as an artist, while bringing together the broader community. -->
