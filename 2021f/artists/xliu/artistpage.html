  Artist Statement:
  I have always been very interested in Japanese traditional culture. Including folk legends, ancient buildings such as Torii, Kabuki, Japanese Ukiyo-e style, and modern Japanese anime. For the graduate exhibition project, I decided to show my love for this culture through blender modeling in the form of character design by Blender. The character prototype comes from Japanese painters and related documents during the Edo period. Online exhibitions require a closed exhibition area with Japanese-related Ukiyo-e on the surrounding walls.
  Although I know that the monsters are not real, I am still curious about the story behind the monsters. Many monsters are derived from people's feelings. So, I think this is also the reason for their fascinating existence. I think the most special thing about people is their rich feelings. The monsters have evolved because of people's desire, greed, love, and sadness. Monsters are not bad, on the contrary, they can reflect the bad situation that people were out of at the time or can represent many people. And the appearance of a monster is derived from people's imagination, and people's emotions are also determined by the appearance of a monster. Many Japanese painters have painted ukiyo-e of yokai. I love the look of different yokai in the painting, as well as the rich colors and unique ukiyo-e style. I will use Mozilla Hubs as the platform to present my personal gallery and my models.
  Monsters were a supernatural existence for people at that time. But with the continuous advancement of technology, fewer and fewer people will believe or be curious about their existence. I hope he will not gradually disappear from people's sight, because monsters are also a very interesting culture. I know that my current artwork is not so mature, or there are many areas for improvement. But I will continue to learn and make my work more successful and attractive. I am happy to share my artwork with you! -->
