  Artist Statement
  War has always and will forever be one of the worst experiences anyone can experience in their lives no matter how they are involved with it. However, as a child, my mom did not really understand the horrors, the fear, the anxiety, the uncertainty, and the helplessness that came about during war. All that was going through her mind was “this is a new experience, and I am having fun.” 

  Two Sides is a multidisciplinary digital installation conceived through conversations with my mother about her experience throughout the Vietnam war until her eventual escape. This project contrasts the horrors of the Vietnam war through the innocent eyes of a little girl. The project consists of lights, soundscape, photography, video, and 3D models. 
  As an interactive virtual world, Two Sides allows the viewer to peer into the inner thoughts of my mother during her time in the Vietnam war. Despite all that was happening around her and the situation she was in, she still did not understand. She was simply to young. I want people to understand and relate to my mother’s experiences during the war.

  This project aims to show people some of the horrors of the Vietnam war while also sharing the account of one person’s experience during the war. Narratives are crafted by the people in power. San Jose has one of the largest Vietnamese population in the United States. Many of those people have gone through similar experiences like my mom. I hope that those people can resonate with my mothers experience. Those experiences have left numerous traumas that have affect first generation Asian American house holds for decades. I hope that we as a community can come together, talk about these experiences and heal together. -->
