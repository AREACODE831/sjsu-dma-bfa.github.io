  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p style="text-align: center">"“Reality is that which, when we stop believing in it, doesn’t go away.”</p>

<p>An interactive commentary on what it really means to traverse the current human condition, Waking from a Dream invites a contemplation of the dark undertones of of humanity’s capitalist and exploitative nature. Digital media artist Clay Bedinger critiques the propaganda of the American Dream, and attempts to capture his own emotional experience of waking from said dream - the viewer interactively joins the artist in stumbling through a dark maze of hollow promises and diversions, eventually throwing aside the facade and finding themselves lost and surrounded by the bleakness of reality. The journey is both a reach backwards in time to distinct moments in the artist's upbringing, and an active commentary on the current political and societal circumstances we all find ourselves facing.</p>

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<hr>
<p>Contrarian, critical, and curious - Clay Bedinger’s pursuit of truth leads him down paths of exploration and skepticism, investigating the fabric of reality that others take for granted. As a digital artist captivated by nature, his innate love of natural beauty is a unifying theme in his sprawling body of work. But here Clay finds his soul in conflict - he is deeply troubled by the sharp contrast between the fragile harmony of nature and the encroaching toxicity of mankind, and yet owes much of his way of life (including the relevance of his art practice) to the age of technology. Indeed, the greatest challenge in his life to date is simply to make peace with himself, and this struggle manifests in his work.</p>
