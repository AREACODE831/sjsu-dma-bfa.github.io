<p>Contrarian, critical, and curious - Clay Bedingerâ€™s pursuit of truth leads him down paths of exploration and skepticism, investigating the fabric of reality that others take for granted. As a digital artist captivated by nature, his innate love of natural beauty is a unifying theme in his sprawling body of work. But here Clay finds his soul in conflict - he is deeply troubled by the sharp contrast between the fragile harmony of nature and the encroaching toxicity of mankind, and yet owes much of his way of life (including the relevance of his art practice) to the age of technology. Indeed, the greatest challenge in his life to date is simply to make peace with himself, and this struggle manifests in his work.</p>
