  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I create work to center and ground my placement in the world. I am not limited to any medium and always open to working and helping others. My work centers in around questions and experiments of what it means to be human and interact with the world. I do so by raising questions, thinking about my medium, and how to present it the best way to spread my message of how we are capable of thinking and making something important.

From living in Guangdong, Guangzhou, China during the ages of 9-14, I had to navigate a world where observational and pattern seeking skills aided in learning the unknown language creatively. I believe that through our relationship to others, media, and our past memories, I hope to bring about my explorations of identity as a catalyst for change. To create work to bring awareness to the familiar and bridge the connection between the spaces between us all.

<p>Sabrina Kwong is a Chinese-American artist, dancer, and a poet of images and words. They create works of art that center around the concepts of self identity, cultural upbringing, wellness, and the spaces between bodies through technological and traditional mediums.

Kwong also works with pieces that delve into the human experience, empathy, and experimentation. They are a firm believer of what emotions are able to teach us in navigating memory spaces and world around us.

  <h2>Project Description</h2>
<hr>
<p>Wedding Veil is a series of sculptural pieces that explores medium and materiality, representational aesthetics, cultural-social identities, and conceptual commitments to art.</p>
  <br></br> 
 <p> When entered upon the insides of a glass container, one becomes amidst tea bag covers shapes as a torso. A sculpture of the artist is seen as well as a video installation of performative movement.

A subtle and nuanced critique on the artist’s identifying roles being Chinese and American, being seen as a gender-queer woman, and labels we all wear. One is packaged into society, leaving sediments of our beings that are now being left in spaces away from one’s physical self.
  </p>
<br> <br>
  <p>
Not site-specific but rather site-adapted, the subjective exploration of the presented medium of teabags have been imitatively mass-produced digitally to critique the production of the object itself. Presenting a conceptually and sculpturally approach to what it means to look at tea bags in a representationally aesthetic way invites viewers to think about each piece that they see in the gallery space.

Movement is shown as a process to not only think, but feel. A suit made out of the chosen medium elaborates the means as well as the historical and social importance of layers that we consume and disregard. Enter Wedding Veil: The Space Between to explore such spaces of thought and discussion.
