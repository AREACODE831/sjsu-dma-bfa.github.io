  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>The COVID-19 pandemic has affected the whole world in different, shocking ways. As I conquered the year 2020 inside my humble abode, I encountered mental health issues that took a toll in my daily life. This inspired me to build habits that centered on practicing self-love. The thoughts and emotions that lived in my mind rent free were expressed through art. I was able to start a collection of artwork that featured SUNNY, a recurring character that I started to implement on my creations during the pandemic.

SUNNY is a mobile application prototype focused on the importance of one’s self-love and mental health. The application features SUNNY, a character inspired from the optimism and support that I have gotten from my loved ones during the pandemic. The character SUNNY acts as the bridge between the user and content, depicting a persona that would create a casual and genuine connection with the user. With the intentions of paying back the help I’ve received from people throughout the pandemic, I created this prototype to create awareness focused on the importance of mental health and the power that lies in knowing that there’s a community behind your back.

SUNNY, the recurring character in my work during the pandemic is inspired from the support that I received from my loved ones. The character features colorful flowers as its set of eyes. The flower represents my growth as a person that bloomed through the unconditional love and support that was shown to me when I was going through my personal struggles and problems.
