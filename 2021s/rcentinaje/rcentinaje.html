  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>3D sculptures, simulations, and rendered portraits of the human figure and skin make up the piece In My Own Skin. Each piece experiments with different nodes to achieve the effect of  wrinkles, acne, dry skin, excess skin, light skin, and pigmentation. Using simple polygons, these abstract shapes convey different body types and sizes. This project is important because feeling positive and accepting one's appearance can be an important factor for a person's mental health. This piece hopes to challenge perceptions about how people look at others' bodies as well as their own. If these perceptions can be changed, society's negative views on acne, wrinkled skin, aging, being fat, etc. can be viewed in a different light.

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<hr>
<p>Based in the San Francisco Bay Area, Rachel is a soon to be graduate of Bachelor of Fine Arts in Digital Media Art in San Jose State University. Throughout the course of the Digital Media Art Program, Rachel has completed courses that included working with 3D printing/modeling, programming, video art, and other digital mediums. The inspiration of her works range from current events, music, nature, personal experiences, pop culture, to identity and more. Her works use a range of distortion, psychedelic, repetition, and colorful stylized imagery.  The two pieces Highlight and Color and Love explore the beauty standards in our modern society that is obsessed with perfection with the introduction of technology. At the moment, her work ties into her augmented reality piece Highlight. It uses colorful outlines to highlight the features of stretch marks instead of it being digitally erased. Color & Love is a fake skin care product designed to interrogate the beauty standard of having white/fair skin. Beauty Standards have shifted immensely as technology creates unrealistic standards for society.
