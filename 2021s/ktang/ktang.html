  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Since last year, the pandemic has changed our life in various ways. My house and my room have become the only range of activity after entered the online study format. My schoolwork, entertainment, and self-practice in digital illustration have become my daily activity. The first few months, I think this style is what I am dreaming of in the past because I am a relatively introverted person, don't like going out and socializing. But I start to feel tired and annoying with this kind of style as it goes on for more than a year. I have become lazy and unmotivated than in the past for completing tasks.

Comfort is a project that I turn this experience into a 3D environment and short animations to express the feeling emotionally through experiencing. I made the 3D environment in Blender and short animation from Photoshop and After Effect. It narrates the complex experience with both comfort and discomfort inside the range of activity. It is also one of the few works that I illustrate about myself and a chance to review myself in a different aspect.
