    <!-- Description -->
    <h2>Description</h2>
    <h3>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Since last year, the pandemic has changed our life in various ways. My house and my room become my only place for activity after everything moved online format. My schoolwork, entertainment, and self-practice in digital illustration have become my daily activities. The first few months, I think this style is what I am dreaming of in the past because I am a relatively introverted person, don't like going out and socializing. But I start to feel tired and annoying with this kind of style as it goes on for more than a year. I have become lazier and unmotivated than in the past.<br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Therefore, I turn this thought into a 3D environment with short animations to express the feeling through experience. I animated the 3D environment in Blender and two short animations in Photoshop and After Effect. It narrates the boundary between comfort and discomfort inside and outside the range of activities. It is also one of the few works that I illustrate about myself and express about myself. <br>
&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;The idea of the project is to experience comfort and discomfort by exploring the exterior and interior environment with audios. The contents here emphasized the influential events that we have been through since last year. This 3D environment was built and animated in Blender and Photoshop for the two short animations. The reason why a house and a room because it speaks about my experience with comfort. They are my imaginary house and room. House by itself already expresses a sense of comfort and security. The room is where most of my daily activities at since the quarantine after everything moved online. Therefore, I decided to use the house and the room for this project.
