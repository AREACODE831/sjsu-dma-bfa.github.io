  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>“Magnum Opus” is a stream of consciousness work about fictional painter Michael Miller. Clouded by his own pride and illusions of grandeur Michael struggles to put paint on canvas, and exposes his insecurities in a discussion with a figment of his own imagination.
I got the idea to create this film after watching an incredibly egotistical video by artist Sean Landers. After watching said video I tried my hardest to place myself Into Sean Lander’s mind at the moment of posting, how could one be so self-centered? With this project I seek to deconstruct the artist's ego, and explore the innate self doubt many feel when we compare ourselves to the greatness that adorns the halls of time. Using the video principle of rotoscoping I animate a version of our painter which is distorted and abstract. This works as a visualization of the internal dialogue previously mentioned.
The gallery component includes an unfinished painting series called “Bane” from fictional painter Michael Miller. Through these paintings Michael Miller seeks to encapsulate each of the deadly sins through abstract acrylic strokes and stylized words and letters. Within each of the paintings the painter strives to capture a personalized chaos that each sin embodies for him.
