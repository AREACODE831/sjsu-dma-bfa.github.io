  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Mountainose is a 3D scan of my nose that is edited on Blender and imported using GLTF. My work is about the colonialism mentality that is ingrained in the Filipino community of physically having a “flat nose”. With Western cultures being the number one influence, Filipinos are losing their sense of culture. I immigrated here in the United States at a young age from the Philippines, so my Filipino culture has slowly been diminishing. I am now accustomed to the “American lifestyle”, and since my Filipino culture has been left out, I do not appreciate it as much.

With my “flat nose”, I want to glorify and acknowledge this insecurity that a lot of Filipinos go through in their day-to-day lives. I also want to open up the conversation to people who feel like their physical appearances aren’t enough and they do not appreciate it. Furthermore, I expanded on the colonial mentality in the commercial world of skin whitening industries.

I made a physical soap brand called, “Totoo” to express also the colonial mentality that western culture put upon the filipino culture. The soap box and the soap itself is a 3D scan that was processed in TRNIO and imported, then edited on Blender.

These skin whitening products are greatly destructive to the physical and mental well-being. Filipinos have the tendency to break away from their native culture, being their appearance. The skin whitening industry targets mostly the lower income groups using the soap to increase aesthetic appeal, economic and social status.

Totoo means “real” in filipino and a lot of soap brands have the word “original” on the front cover. This brings up a conversation about authenticity and the manipulation that is in the advertising world.

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>

</p>
<h2>Project Description</h2>
<hr>
<p> I want the viewer(s) to experience the space as a traveler on a journey to a sacred land. That sacred land consist of an insecurity that a lot of Filipinos have and that is their flat noses. Also, I expanded the conversation about the colonial mentality that is still happening in the Philippines and other third world countries with the skin-whitening soap industry. In the mountainose, the nostrils are entrances to two different soap commercials that are in a form of an abstract. The adveritsing world has always been manipulating these third-world countries that people actually believe what they are presenting is valuable and true.
