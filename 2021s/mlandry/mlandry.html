  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>I am a digital illustrator but love to explore all sorts of different tools and media. I’m continually working to improve my technical skills and refine my personal aesthetic. I specialize in fantasy character and creature depictions and designs and often feature them centrally in my art. My goal as an artist is to work as a character designer, illustrator, or sculptor for games, and a lot of my art is practice in that pursuit. I find gaming to be a powerful and ever-evolving narrative tool that lets its audience connect with characters and ideas and worlds in a personal and effective way that’s difficult to achieve with more passive media.

My art is soft and beautiful with a peaceful, enjoyable atmosphere, but I like to also include darker or deeper themes through a warping of the conventionally beautiful or as a beautiful idealization of the unsettling. We sometimes hold our lizard brain in contempt, but I see it as a gateway to more enthusiastically engage with difficult ideas.

I keep politics and social issues subtle, but death, feminism, and self expression are frequent sources of inspiration. I’m fascinated and terrified by my own and our species’ collective mortality, and I find art to be an excellent tool to work through that web of ideas and find a universal means of connection through the discussion of a shared fate. Similarly, the social policing of women’s bodies and behavior is often on my mind when creating character art.

Cold Like the Sun is an animated digital painting created with Photoshop, Live2D, and Premiere. It loosely responds to admiration of all things superficially “natural” and the anti-human, anti-science sentiment stemming from it. The character is not a personification of nature, but more a superhuman idolic manifestation of a certain perception of it. While fantasy portrayals of characters like these tend to be gentle, wise guardians, this narrative presents its character as equally alluring but also detached and uncaring, a passive perpetuator of life and death, neither good nor evil. However, this is mostly inspiration and backstory to the work, a feeling, not a message.

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<hr>
  <p>Meghan Landry was born in Maryland, grew up in rural Illinois, and in 2016 moved to San Jose, California. She has maintained an interest in drawing and crafting since early childhood. She attends San Jose State University as a Digital Media Art student.
Meghan's broad yet distractible curiosity has led her to pick up many different kinds of media, both digital and traditional, but digital tools and software are where most of her time is spent. She is primarily a character illustrator using Photoshop and a graphics tablet. She also has an interest in organic sculpting in ZBrush, animation in Live2D and After Effects, and web coding, generally all to the end of adapting or enhancing her illustrations. She highly regards technical proficiency and aims to set and achieve certain visions for her art on a technical and personal aesthetic level and to be perpetually learning and critically evaluating her work. She continues to create and explore art as the function of a basic drive to do so.
