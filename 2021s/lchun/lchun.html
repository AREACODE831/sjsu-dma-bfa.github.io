  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Curtain Call is more or less a celebration of the journey I have taken to get to where I am now.
Each scene represents the past, present, and future transitioning to a new season of my life. The phrase Curtain Call refers to the appearance of the actors after the last act to acknowledge the audience.The theater has been a metaphor for my art practice in virtual reality. Just like an audience member it is a 360 experience. The audience is watching the show from the main stage to the sides and the ceiling. The props and scene settings dress the stage where the audienceâ€™s main attention is focused to create the suspension of disbelief.As a former tech theater kid, I spent many days and nights in all black sneaking behind the scenes and watching the audience and the show from the top of the theater. These different vignettes of times in my life help shape who I am and where I am going.</p>
