  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <p>As a digital media artist, I use my life experiences and what Iâ€™ve witnessed in my travels in nature to bridge the gap between imagination and real world ideas and to shape the way I make my digital paintings in Adobe Photoshop and Illustrator. I take concepts from real life nature elements such as forests, outer space, oceans, flowers, skies and animals to incorporate them into my practice, depict life messages, and convey the benefits of protecting nature. I take my inspiration from nature and my life experiences, especially my hardships and pain, to create fictional worlds that represent my connection between real world ideas and experiences to imaginative ones.
</p>
<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
  <p>Jessica Prakash is a digital media artist that grew up in San Jose, California. She studies at San Jose State and will be receiving her BFA in May 2021. At San Jose State, she worked with design, video and image editing, photography, 3D modelling, and digital painting. Her work focuses on using elements from nature to create fictional worlds and tell stories connected to her life experiences, travels and family history.

Her ancestors, which were originally from India, were forced to move to Fiji Islands, where they had struggled with hardships, all while keeping their culture alive. After many years, they were all able to build better lives, which is exactly what happened to Jessica, since her parents were from Fiji, and immigrated to America, where Jessica was born and raised. Family history is what allowed her to become more fascinated in travel and nature. As a digital media artist, Jessica uses her life experiences to inspire her messages and stories told within her digital art.
