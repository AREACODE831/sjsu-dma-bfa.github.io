  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Euphoria Daydream is a digital 3D representation of a fictional dream-like world I wish to escape to when I experience hardships and pain. The major life event that caused me to wish to escape to this type of world was the unexpected passing of my beloved grandmother in September of 2020. The most tragic event of my life influenced the creation of this 3D fantasy, forest-like environment, which contains symbolic elements connected to nature, life, prosperity and being free from struggles and pain. The main elements of this piece contain symbolic messages connected to my life experiences and are inspired by messages that are significant to my life. The mountains connect to adventure and the idea of going through obstacles in life and climbing your way to the top, which is success. The colorful flowers and trees all signify growth, prosperity and the start of a new beginning in a new world. By using my inner emotions and thinking deeper about my hardships, I am able to bring my dream world from my imagination to life.

<h2>Artist Bio</h2>
<hr>
  <p>Jessica Prakash is a digital media artist that grew up in San Jose, California. She studies at San Jose State and will be receiving her BFA in May 2021. At San Jose State, she worked with design, video and image editing, photography, 3D modelling, and digital painting. Her work focuses on using elements from nature to create fictional worlds and tell stories connected to her life experiences, travels and family history.

Her ancestors, which were originally from India, were forced to move to Fiji Islands, where they had struggled with hardships, all while keeping their culture alive. After many years, they were all able to build better lives, which is exactly what happened to Jessica, since her parents were from Fiji, and immigrated to America, where Jessica was born and raised. Family history is what allowed her to become more fascinated in travel and nature. As a digital media artist, Jessica uses her life experiences to inspire her messages and stories told within her digital art.
