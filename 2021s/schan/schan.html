  <h2>Artist Statement</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>My work includes a hybrid of photography, digital art and illustration work. Since I have experience with such a variety of mediums I consider myself to be a digital media artist. Growing up in a digital revolution has inspired me to investigate how various technologies can be incorporated and/or enhanced into my artwork. As I grew accustomed to the field, my interest has shifted into 3D modeling and design which I intend to pursue after I finish the BFA Digital Media Art program at San Jose State University. I will be continuing my studies for 3D environmental art and game design.
</p>
  <h2>Artist Bio</h2>
  <hr>
  <p>Sabrina Chan is a multimedia artist who tends to focus on digital illustration. Through the course of her education at San Jose State University, she has learned a variety of programs such as Blender, Python, JavaScript, After Effects, Fusion 360, and many others. Once Sabrina graduates from the BFA program, she intends to take more courses pertaining to UI and UX design as well as 3d modeling to pursue a career in a field that merges art and technology to make a better experience for users of all media types.

<h2>Project Description</h2>
<hr>
<p> The purpose of this series was to explore an imaginary world of my creation to immerse others and to hopefully spur them to think about what their own worlds could look like. The main themes surrounding the project are escapism and exploration. In relation to my artistic practice, I was previously a illustrative artist. Over the course of the DMA program, I learned 3D modeling and have grown very interested in pursuing 3D as an artistic medium. For this project, my aim was to incorporate my digital illustrative style into a 3D form. The biggest influence for this project was the pandemic which caused us to remain indoors for a year. Being stuck inside left me finding other means to escape the world's current political climate. My other classes at the time focused on building 3D environments to immerse others and so I wanted to create my own imaginary world where I could escape to and allow others into my world as well.
